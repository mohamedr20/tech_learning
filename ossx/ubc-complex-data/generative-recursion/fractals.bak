; PROBLEM: 
; 
; Design a function that consumes a number and produces a Sierpinski
; triangle of that size. Your function should use generative recursion.
; 
; One way to draw a Sierpinski triangle is to:
; 
;  - start with an equilateral triangle with side length s
;  
;      .
;      
;  - inside that triangle are three more Sierpinski triangles
;      .
;      
;  - and inside each of those... and so on
;  
; So that you end up with something that looks like this:
;    
; 
;    
; 
; .
;    
; Note that in the 2nd picture above the inner triangles are drawn in 
; black and slightly smaller just to make them clear. In the real
; Sierpinski triangle they should be in the same color and of side
; length s/2. Also note that the center upside down triangle is not
; an explicit triangle, it is simply formed from the other triangles.
